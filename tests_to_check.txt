+ test with these maps:

	1, empty map, absolutly nothing in it!
	2, valid map with \n in the middle
	3, valid map with 1 \n at the end

___________

we can have a file called parsing that has the function parse
	that does the job the main function is doing right now! 

=> what will this function need? 




___________

that case where the map is not valid asat exit function 
	needs to be imported from the ft_exit file i think!

	and if that file gets too big (more than 5 functions)

	make if a directory called errors and have all the error 
		handling and exiting functions in there!
