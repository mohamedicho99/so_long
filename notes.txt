check out that y, even in a valid map! it gives you the actual
	number of lines in the map + 1! why is that?

that last line is null! check out what happens if we add a condition in there
	to break once we hit it!

when should we check if the map is empty or not?

how about a function that frees everything and just called it ft_exit
